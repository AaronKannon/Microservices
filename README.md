# Microservices
### A product-catalog and shopping-cart microservice, with gateway, service discovery, service discovery server, and circuit breaker

Created because of the proposed project by Digital Innovation Inc., to create a microservices API about buying products.
The services present are:
- Product Catalog
- Shopping Cart
- Gateway
- Service Discovery
- Configuration server

**The Git repository that haves the services configuration files:**

```shell script
https://github.com/AaronKannon/Microservices-config.git
```

**Each folder is a IntelliJ project alone, to execute one to one, use the command:**
```shell script
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## To-do:

- Structure the services to be more RESTful
- Create the Service Java files to product-catalog and shopping-cart
